#Housing prices prediction

This is my first project on data science where  I used basic machine learning.<br>
I picked this project from kaggle which is website for data science.<br>
###What is this project about ?###<br>
So, here you will be given the train data and test data where you have to use the tarin data to predict the test data
and submit it. Here I used some basic machine learning and used RandomForestRegressor to fit the model. I used the mean
absolute error from sklearn library to make sure how much accurate my predictions are.

***If there are any suggestions on this code please open up a issue int he issues channel so that if relevant you can cotribute the code***
